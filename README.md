# Hi, I'm Russ 'trdwll' Treadwell. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology enthusiast with nearly a decade of experience. I'm a self-taught programmer with a background in C++, C#, and Python. I enjoy rapid prototyping, writing clean consistent code, and helping out my peers. I'm interested in game engine architecture, game development, and backend web development.
